Here's a comprehensive list of important data structures that are widely used in various domains of computer science and programming:

1. **Array**: A collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.

2. **Linked List**: A data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a reference to the next node.

3. **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end (top).

4. **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.

5. **Heap**: A complete binary tree-based data structure with a heap property, commonly used for priority queue operations.

6. **Tree**: A hierarchical data structure with nodes connected by edges, consisting of a root node and subtrees.

7. **Binary Tree**: A tree data structure where each node has at most two children.

8. **Binary Search Tree**: A binary tree where the left child of a node contains a value smaller than the node, and the right child contains a value greater than the node.

9. **Graph**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, representing relationships between entities.

10. **Hash Table**: A data structure that stores key-value pairs and provides efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations.

11. **Priority Queue**: A queue where elements have a priority associated with them, and the element with the highest priority is dequeued first.

12. **Trie**: A tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of keys, primarily used for string operations.

13. **Set**: A collection of unique elements with no specific order.

14. **Hash Set**: A set implemented using a hash table, providing constant-time average case operations.

15. **Linked Hash Set**: A set that maintains the order of insertion using a linked list and allows constant-time operations.

16. **Map**: A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.

17. **Hash Map**: A map implemented using a hash table, providing efficient key-value pair operations.

18. **Linked Hash Map**: A map that maintains the order of insertion using a linked list and allows constant-time operations.

19. **Bloom Filter**: A probabilistic data structure used for efficient membership queries.

20. **Red-Black Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree with guaranteed logarithmic time operations.

These data structures cover a wide range of fundamental concepts and provide efficient solutions for various types of data storage and manipulation problems. By learning and understanding these data structures, you'll have a strong foundation for organizing and managing data effectively in your programs.
