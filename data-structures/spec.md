# List of Important Data Structures

1. Arrays:
   - A collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.

2. Linked Lists:
   - A linear data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a reference to the next node.

3. Stacks:
   - A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from one end (top).

4. Queues:
   - A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).

5. Trees:
   - A hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, with a single root node and child nodes connected by edges.

6. Binary Trees:
   - A tree data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right).

7. Binary Search Trees (BST):
   - A binary tree where the left child of a node contains a smaller value, and the right child contains a larger value.

8. Heaps:
   - A complete binary tree with a special property where the parent node has a higher (or lower) value than its children.

9. Hash Tables:
   - A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function for efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion.

10. Graphs:
    - A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, used to represent relationships between objects.

11. Hash Sets:
    - A data structure that stores a collection of unique elements, providing efficient membership tests.

12. Hash Maps:
    - A data structure that maps keys to values, allowing efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval.

13. Priority Queues:
    - A data structure where elements have associated priorities and are dequeued based on their priority.

14. Trie:
    - A tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of keys in a dataset, often used for text-related operations.

15. Disjoint Sets (Union-Find):
    - A data structure that keeps track of a set of disjoint elements, commonly used for grouping and connectivity problems.

16. Balanced Search Trees:
    - Trees that self-balance to ensure efficient operations (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees).

17. Graph Representations:
    - Different ways to represent graphs, such as adjacency matrix and adjacency list.

18. Graph Algorithms:
    - Algorithms for traversing and manipulating graphs, such as breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).
