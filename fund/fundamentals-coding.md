# List of Core Programming Concepts

1. Variables and Data Types:
   - Declaring and using variables
   - Primitive data types (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, booleans)
   - Strings and characters
   - Arrays and collections

2. Control Structures:
   - Conditional statements (e.g., if-else, switch)
   - Loops (e.g., for, while, do-while)
   - Break and continue statements

3. Functions and Methods:
   - Defining and calling functions
   - Parameters and return values
   - Function overloading
   - Recursion

4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
   - Classes and objects
   - Inheritance
   - Polymorphism
   - Encapsulation
   - Abstraction

5. Exception Handling:
   - Handling and throwing exceptions
   - Try-catch blocks
   - Finally block
   - Custom exception classes

6. Input and Output (I/O):
   - Reading and writing data to/from files
   - User input and output (e.g., console, command line)

7. Data Structures:
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Trees
   - Graphs

8. Algorithms:
   - Searching (e.g., linear search, binary search)
   - Sorting (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort)
   - Recursion
   - Dynamic programming
   - Graph algorithms (e.g., DFS, BFS)

9. Memory Management:
   - Stack and heap memory
   - Memory allocation and de-allocation
   - Garbage collection (in managed languages)

10. File Handling:
    - Opening, reading, and writing files
    - File streams and buffers
    - Error handling and resource cleanup

11. Concurrency and Multithreading:
    - Thread creation and synchronization
    - Race conditions and deadlocks
    - Parallel programming concepts

12. Debugging and Testing:
    - Debugging techniques and tools
    - Unit testing and test-driven development (TDD)
    - Test frameworks and assertions
