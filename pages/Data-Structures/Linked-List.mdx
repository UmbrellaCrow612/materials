## Linked Lists

A linked list is a dynamic data structure that represents a sequence of elements, where each element is stored in a node. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node contains the element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

### Node Structure

In a singly linked list, each node typically consists of two parts: the data (element) and a reference to the next node. Here's an example of a node structure in Java:

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;
}
```

In this example, `data` holds the value of the element, and `next` points to the next node in the list.

### Linked List Structure

A linked list is formed by connecting nodes together using the `next` reference. The first node is called the head, and the last node's `next` reference points to null, indicating the end of the list. Here's an illustration of a linked list:

```
Head -> [Node1] -> [Node2] -> [Node3] -> null
```

In this example, the head points to Node1, which is followed by Node2, Node3, and so on.

### Types of Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List**: Each node has a reference to the next node in the sequence.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has references to both the next and previous nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.
- **Circular Linked List**: The last node's `next` reference points back to the head, forming a circular structure.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

Linked lists offer several advantages:

- Dynamic size: Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically by adding or removing nodes.
- Efficient insertion and deletion: Adding or removing nodes requires adjusting a few references, resulting in constant-time operations.
- Flexibility: Linked lists can accommodate elements of different sizes and can be easily modified.

However, linked lists also have some disadvantages:

- Sequential access: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not provide direct access to elements by index. Sequential traversal is necessary to access specific elements.
- Extra memory overhead: Each node in a linked list requires additional memory to store the element and reference, which can lead to higher memory consumption compared to arrays.

### Common Operations

Linked lists support various operations for manipulating the data:

- **Traversal**: Iterating over the nodes to perform operations on each element.
- **Insertion**: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or any specific position in the list.
- **Deletion**: Removing a node from the list, adjusting the references accordingly.
- **Searching**: Finding a specific element in the list by traversing the nodes.
- **Reversing**: Changing the order of the nodes to reverse the linked list.
- **Merging**: Combining two separate linked lists into a single linked list.

### Summary

Linked lists are dynamic data structures that provide flexibility in managing a sequence of elements. They consist of nodes connected through references, allowing efficient insertion and deletion operations. Linked lists are suitable when dynamic size changes are expected and direct random access is not a requirement. By understanding linked lists, you gain a valuable tool for efficient data manipulation and storage in various programming scenarios.
